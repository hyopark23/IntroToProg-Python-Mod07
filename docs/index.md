# Exceptions Handling & Pickling in Python  
Exceptions refers to unexpected error happening in Python that it cannot handle, and the program halting due to result. Suppose there is a simple program that asks the user to enter two numbers in which the first number is divided by the second number.

## Introduction

For this assignment, we were asked to research on our own the two main topics of this module: exceptions handling and pickling. I will explain what the two Python features are, how they are used, and what makes them useful. 

## Exceptions Handling

## Pickling

## Summary

As programs get more complex, we must account for all sorts of different inputs and scenarios that the user might try with the program. Exception handling is meant just for that, as it provides us with different ways to deal with errors then simply letting a program abruptly halt. Pickling (and un-pickling) is a more efficient ways for us to manipulate writing/reading from a file as it can deal with complex objects such as dictionary or sets. It also allows transmit of data over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or socket connection (Pickle in Python: Object Serialization, https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pickle-python-tutorial) (external site).
These new concepts will allow us to build more functional and user-friendly programs going forward.
